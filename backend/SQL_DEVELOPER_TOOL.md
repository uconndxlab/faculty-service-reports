# SQL Developer

Oracle provides an SQL Developer tool for download on their site, which is a graphical tool for managing Oracle SQL database.

You will need Java SE Development Kit 11.

I was able to find everything on the official [oracle download pages](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html).
